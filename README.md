### sql-challenge

#### This SQL challenge dives into data modeling and analysis skills. Employee data is pulled from Pewlett Hackard Corperation from the 1980s to the 1990s. Data sets are provided in "CSV" format. Databases were created using Postgres and tables were created before importing the "CSV" files to fill the tables. 

### The overall task of this challenge, was to perform data modeling and data analysis for the following:

## Data Modeling
### The schema of six "CSV" files were manipulated using PostreSQL. Using PostreSQL, primary keys, data types, and foreign keys were defined. Once tables were created and data types defined, the CSV files were imported to fill out the tables. Relationships were generated using and ERD image to later conduct analysis.

## Data Anlysis
### The analysis was also performed using PostgreSQL. Analysis was performed by creating queries to extract information from the tables previously created in the database. 

## Epilogue
### The final step in the challenge was to search employee ID number 499942. After searching this employee ID number, the results returned a joke! The name of the employee was "April Foolsday!"
